# Timer Functionality Documentation

## Overview
The CodeClash platform now includes intelligent timer functionality that handles user logout/login scenarios properly. The timer automatically pauses when users log out and resumes when they log back in, ensuring accurate time tracking for problem-solving sessions.

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Timer Pause on Logout
- When a user logs out, all active timer sessions are automatically paused
- Session data is preserved in localStorage with logout timestamp
- Timer intervals are cleared to prevent background counting

### 2. Automatic Timer Resume on Login
- When a user logs back in and visits a problem page, the timer automatically resumes
- The timer accounts for the time spent logged out by adjusting the start time
- Session status is updated to reflect the resumed state

### 3. Session State Management
- **Active**: Timer is currently running
- **Paused**: Timer is paused (page hidden, navigation away)
- **Paused (Logged Out)**: Timer was paused due to logout
- **Completed**: Problem was successfully solved, timer won't resume

### 4. Visual Indicators
- Timer status is displayed next to the time counter
- Color-coded status indicators:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Active
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Paused
  - ðŸ”µ Blue: Completed
  - âšª Gray: Not Started/Error

## Technical Implementation

### Timer Session Data Structure
```javascript
{
  isActive: boolean,           // Whether timer is currently running
  startTime: number,          // Original start timestamp
  lastActive: number,         // Last activity timestamp
  logoutTime: number,         // When user logged out (if applicable)
  isCompleted: boolean,       // Whether problem was completed
  completionTime: number,     // When problem was completed
  totalTime: number          // Total time taken (in seconds)
}
```

### Key Functions

#### AuthContext.logout()
- Clears all active timer sessions for the user
- Marks sessions as inactive with logout timestamp
- Prevents timer from running in background

#### ProblemSolver Timer Initialization
- Checks for existing sessions on component mount
- Resumes paused sessions with time adjustment
- Prevents resuming completed sessions

#### Session Management
- `handleBack()`: Pauses timer when navigating away
- `handleRefreshCode()`: Resets timer completely
- `handleSubmit()`: Marks session as completed on successful submission

## User Experience

### Scenario 1: Normal Problem Solving
1. User starts solving a problem â†’ Timer starts
2. User works on problem â†’ Timer runs continuously
3. User completes problem â†’ Timer stops, session marked as completed

### Scenario 2: Logout During Problem Solving
1. User starts solving a problem â†’ Timer starts
2. User logs out â†’ Timer pauses, session saved with logout time
3. User logs back in later â†’ Timer resumes, accounting for logout time
4. User continues solving â†’ Timer continues from where it left off

### Scenario 3: Page Navigation
1. User starts solving a problem â†’ Timer starts
2. User navigates away â†’ Timer pauses
3. User returns to problem â†’ Timer resumes
4. User completes problem â†’ Timer stops, session completed

## Browser Compatibility
- Uses localStorage for session persistence
- Works with sessionStorage for authentication
- Handles page visibility changes
- Compatible with modern browsers

## Debug Information
Timer session information is logged to the console for debugging purposes. You can view this information by opening the browser's developer tools and checking the console when on a problem page.

## Testing the Functionality

1. **Start a problem**: Navigate to any problem and start coding
2. **Check timer**: Verify timer is running and status shows "Active"
3. **Logout**: Click logout button
4. **Login again**: Log back in and navigate to the same problem
5. **Verify resume**: Timer should resume from where it left off
6. **Check status**: Status should show "Active" again

The timer functionality ensures that users can take breaks, log out, and return to their problem-solving sessions without losing their progress or having inaccurate time tracking.
